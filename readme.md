# freeCodeCamp Wikipedia Viewer Challenge

This repository contains my implementation of the freeCodeCamp Wikipedia challenge. It works with the Wikipedia API and returns ten available articles that contain the search string that was used by the user.

It is available to use at:
https://alaskaa.github.io/wikipedia-viewer/

You can see how the site can be used below.
